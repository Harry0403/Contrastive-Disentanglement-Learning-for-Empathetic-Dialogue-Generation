It was delivered and then because there was still money to be collected, that time I checked and found it was not there. After I collected the money from everyone and it was almost delivery time, the store called me and told me that the price of each item was five yuan more than the actual price. And because at that time, everyone seemed to be studying for the test quickly, so everyone was studying on their own, and it was not suitable to disturb everyone. Then I was very nervous.

I said sorry to the teaching assistant after class, and then rushed back to the dormitory. Then I passed the new file over, and then everyone went up to report it. I just said it directly.

187,77,4,Is that because you said you went back and looked at your old stuff? Why do you think you were like this at that time?,no emotion,inquire
188,78,1,"I don’t know. Let me think about it. I went to class because there was actually cram school at that time. At that time, I may have thought that the teacher’s teachings were not that good.

It's not good and I'm still not very energetic in the morning, so it seems like this has nothing to do with psychological problems.",no emotion,no action

236,90,3,That's right. I will choose not to do this.,no emotion,no action
237,90,4,"But I seemed to find out the reason later. Maybe it was that I always felt that I had to do it perfectly as soon as I did something, and then I was worried that I wouldn’t do it perfectly, so I never wanted to touch that thing. What do you think?",no emotion,inquire
238,91,1,"I am a bit like this myself, that is to say, I feel that I usually feel that if my mental state is not that good, I choose not to do things.

249,94,4,"So today we started from what you said when you talked about procrastination. The first one mentioned that you were not sure whether it was your past practice habit, and then the next one seemed to be that you have to work in a stressful working mode to a certain extent before you can start working. Then it seems that we finally talked about what is it that makes you unable to complete this matter at the time when it should be completed. Is there another possibility that you are worried about whether you will achieve results if you do it now or because of my current state? It doesn’t seem to be the best.

254,96,1,"It would be better, but I also feel that I am a bit criticizing myself now.

257,97,2,"Okay, I think this is actually quite common for me to criticize myself whenever something happens.",no emotion,no action
258,97,3,So you start to criticize yourself about what,no emotion,inquire

275,103,1,"Because I have no experience in consulting before, in my imagination, those who come to communicate and chat should talk about things that they are usually confused or confused about or things that cannot be solved.
