848,256,2,So it sounds like he might not consider others too much or their emotions when interacting.,no emotion,brief description of the semantics
849,256,3,"No, he doesn’t know where the boundaries are with other people, so he’s a boy, maybe I’m the only one in the class, and I’m reasonable. He barely knows how to talk to him, so he doesn’t understand the boundaries of the body, and then he keeps pulling me in, which is a bit of sexual harassment. Later, he was sexually harassed.

850,256,4,It sounds like this is uncomfortable in this interpersonal experience,no emotion,emotional reflection

854,258,2,"Thank you very much for sharing your interpersonal experience with me today. I think it is really sad for you to care about it now. Regardless of whether you are in a group in the university, I think you really value these friends. I didn't expect this at the time. This situation is quite sudden. Although on the one hand, it is understandable that there seems to be a time limit for course selection, there are still some people who feel as if they are not taking them seriously. They do not seem to consider you. So what do you think about what you were just talking about or describing? Do you have any other thoughts or feelings that you want to tell me?",no emotion,inquire/summary

865,261,4,"This is your dream, right? You don’t have to do anything. But it sounds like maybe the academic pressure isn’t that great.",no emotion,inquire
866,262,1,"It’s actually okay now. In fact, when I entered university, I wasn’t under too much academic pressure because I think everyone has to look at how high their demands are.

For the category, you have to roll up to 4:3, and then everyone has to choose the score so that the first place can be determined.",no emotion,no action

870,262,5,"A score of six is ​​a bit higher than average. It should be said that it's on the high side and it's not bad. It's still within the range I can withstand. I'm under a lot of pressure because the coursework is not good enough for me. I have to get A+ in every subject. That's okay, but I have many clubs, so things become quite complicated.",no emotion,no action
871,262,6,"So it sounds like in addition to school life and homework, you also participate in other activities. What are the activities?",no emotion,inquire/brief description of the semantics
872,263,1,"There are quite a lot of things. I really can’t write anything on my resume, but there are a lot of clubs. I first joined the equestrian club and then the equestrian club collapsed because there was no one to take over. No one wanted to take over the cadre. I was a first-year member of the United Equestrian Club in Qingjiao. I also participated in the Sanda Fighting Club. I may go there tonight. Then last semester, there was a plus. Not last semester, last semester, there was a sign language socialization. It seems that the sign language club was established in the 1960s of the Republic of China, and then it fell down. I added one plus all. fall down",happiness,no action
873,263,2,Which club is your favorite or most impressive experience?,no emotion,inquire
874,264,1,"I haven’t finished talking yet. There is also the badminton team or the captain’s club in the department. I think the equestrian club is quite cool. But uh, I didn’t have much opportunity to get in touch with this thing before. Then one class outside costs one or two thousand yuan. It was like this when I was young. Then we went there to help clean and then changed to horse riding because it was too far. I went there a few times and it was very cold. The equestrian club was very cool. The sign language club was also cool. I was exposed to some new things. Then what did the senior of the sign language club say? A rare sign language prodigy in the year",happiness,no action

877,265,2,Do you think the club can help your body and mind?,no emotion,inquire
878,265,3,"That's right. In fact, regulating the body and mind is reading novels and playing tricks. Things that really make you relax are like this. Lie down. The club just provides an exploration. Playing badminton is really because being the captain is aka everyone's servant, right?",no emotion,no action
879,265,4,"There are many things to take care of, right?",no emotion,no action
880,266,1,"I asked the vice-captain to find a football manager to help me share the load, so it was okay, but every practice has to be there. We play two days a week, and it takes a lot of time from 7 to 11 o'clock.",no emotion,no action
881,266,2,It takes time to spend time in a lot of clubs or activities where you may have to take care of other people. It’s quite fun to listen to you. Do you like it if you are keen on these activities?,no emotion,inquire/emotional reflection
882,266,3,"Actually, the better way is to lie down flat",no emotion,no action
883,266,4,This is the way to make you comfortable,no emotion,no action

891,268,2,How to say,no emotion,inquire
892,268,3,"We usually become captains in our junior year, or we become captains in our sophomore year, which means they have to be captain for two years. Because my roommate is the captain of the women's basketball team, she will be captain for two years. It's very hard.",no emotion,no action
893,268,4,How do you say that hard work?,no emotion,no action
894,269,1,"They will have more women's basketball activities. In the past, most of the seniors went back to their parents' homes and so on. We all went to have dinner together to connect with each other. But we have to plan something like this. And is there a vice-captain who doesn't have any basketball experience to help her? We are here alone. Do it over there",no emotion,no action
895,269,2,It sounds like you have to take care of a lot of things alone.,no emotion,brief description of the semantics

903,271,2,This means that you may have to complete a lot of things in the same period of time,no emotion,brief description of the semantics
904,271,3,It’s this kind of painful thing that sometimes feels good in retrospect,no emotion,no action

915,273,4,There may be a lot of things to deal with,no emotion,brief description of the semantics
916,274,1,"It’s not too much. The team and the assistant team helped me carry it, but they kept changing the date, and then they changed the dates.

Like the equestrian club, sign language is very cool, and it may be difficult to come into contact with it.
