It’s because I’m now in my second year of master’s degree, and I’m actually going to start writing a thesis now, so I’m starting to ask the teacher to write the thesis. But in this process, I have been a little hesitant and I feel very hesitant.

When I was looking for information, I saw that many people may have written about similar topics, and then I felt that I couldn't handle this topic, but I really wanted to. I wanted to write about this thing, but I didn't quite know what I should do. What kind of mentality should I have to continue to maintain the pace of this research? Now I feel most embarrassed. I should say that I know very well that I have such an indecisive state. In fact, what I feel most painful now is that actually I should want to be. I shouldn’t tell my individual research teacher about my status, but in fact, because this teacher will leave soon, she is not actually my advisor. That’s right. In fact, I just want to talk to this teacher first. Do it first because the individual studies we take are three credits. If you take one credit in one semester, then it must be divided into three studies. I hope to say that first this semester will be like taking one. I may just do it if this goes well.

In fact, there are many people around me who have read it before. Someone who has passed the master's degree has told me that he said that in the master's thesis, you don't really need to care too much about whether you are good at what you do, as long as you master a good set of research methods. In fact, this is probably the basis of the master's thesis. In fact, I feel that I heard it. I think these words are all useful to me, and I should say that I know what the book is talking about, and I also know that what many people told me is very reasonable. But when I apply it to myself, I don’t know why I still feel like this. Most of them are the kind of low or unmotivated mood. I am still very sure that when I read these materials and literature, I am still very happy. I just say, oh, I can, I can do this. If I have such thoughts and such thoughts, what should I do? How to present it, but when it came time to actually write down the initial idea, I felt like I was stuck on a lot of things, so I hesitated to just write it down, and then I didn’t know what to do, so I wanted to say yes.

But looking back now, I feel that those things will give myself a choice and maybe I quite like it.

I came over like that, and even now I think it’s OK. But I don’t know why, but now I decided to write what I originally liked before. On the contrary, there is a feeling of hesitation in my heart.

Then at that time, I thought, well, I won’t have to schedule so many things next semester, or not at all. After studying so many classes, it is true that my classes and workload this semester are not as many as last semester. But instead, I want to spend more time on my thesis research.

I think the reason why you feel very troubled now is that, uh, it's not just you who thinks, uh, maybe your master's degree. The research process of this thesis is arranged as if you need to produce some output, or that you need to accumulate some progress over a fixed period of time. You have such pressure, but you must continue to make progress within a certain period of time. With this requirement and your current sluggish state, it is difficult for you to implement the requirements that require progress like now, so you will be a little anxious. Your anxiety will make you worry about whether I will be in the slump and depression like this now. In the future, I may be very sad if my progress falls behind. Or if you blame yourself for why you are like this now and can't even cheer up, then you will feel that you can't be like this and you should work hard to cheer up. So you will be very anxious all of a sudden, but then you will feel that why is it like this? It seems that I shouldn't be like this. But although you know that it shouldn't be like this, you just can't do it. You don't know why, so you are stuck in this place and can't move forward. I can't stop and rest because I can't feel at ease when I stop to rest. So there are actually a lot of complex emotions brewing here. If it's like this, I think you should not be too nervous about yourself first. In fact, if you are in this state, It's not abnormal or uncommon, so I think it sounds like you. At least the good news now is that you are actually even in a depressed state, and you find yourself in this state, and you are still willing to deal with it. Face him, so don't feel too bad about yourself, as if you have been letting this state go on. In fact, I think you actually have that positive part, that is, you want to deal with this matter. You also need to see yourself. The next part of this part is that you actually had good experiences in the past, and you also tried to see from past experiences. In fact, when you implemented some of these personal research reports in the past, you actually had good experiences. You also tried to see from past experiences. I'm able to do very well, but I don't know why. I'm not sure where I got stuck this time. It sounds like it might be because the topic is large and the content is relatively deep, or this research has a special significance. For example, it is related to your graduation thesis and whether you can graduate, so maybe it is a certain importance that makes you find it difficult to start, or you have some concerns about this when you are making this report. Some ideas you want or an ideal state in your mind, but you are very worried that you may not be able to reach that ideal state, so it is difficult for you to start this first step.
